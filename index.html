                <p>My name is Jeremy. I’m in the IT – Software Developer program. I’m natively from Madison and I grew up working on and using computers but have never done anything of a professional nature or done much programming prior to this program. I work in the aviation industry and love to travel around the world, see different places, try different food, and experience different cultures.</p>
