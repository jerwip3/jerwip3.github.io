# Jeremy Wipperfurth | Software Dev Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio. It's where I'm documenting my move from a career in aviation to a career in software engineering. I built it to be clean, easy to navigate, and technical enough to show what I've been learning during my degree and in my free time.

## How it was built

This was a project to both build out a personal portfolio page and to learn how to use React paired with Tailwind CSS (and Vite for rapid iterations) to create a modern, responsive webpage.

- **React 19 & Vite:** I used this to move beyond static HTML and explore component based architecture and state management. Vite was essential for the rapid feedback loop during development.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** I specifically chose the newest version of Tailwind to experiment with its "CSS-first" configuration. It allowed me to build a custom brand—like my Navy and Red theme—efficiently.
- **GitHub API:** To keep the site dynamic, I integrated the GitHub API to pull my project data directly from my repositories. This ensures the "Featured Projects" section stays current without manual updates.

## Primary Features

- **Dynamic Cards:** The project grid is automated. It knows which of my repos are pinned, public, and what tech they use.
- **Double Modals:** I built two separate popouts—one for my resume and a "Story" section for a few travel photos and my personal background.
- **Aviation Vibe:** The colors (Navy Blue and Red) are a nod to my time in the airlines.
