# Personal Portfolio Page

This is my personal portfolio. It's where I'm documenting my move from a career in aviation to a career in software engineering. I built it to be clean, easy to navigate, and technical enough to show what I've been learning during my degree and in my free time.

## How it was built

This project served as a way to build a professional presence while gaining hands-on experience with the React ecosystem and modern styling tools.

- **React 19 and Vite:** I moved beyond static HTML to explore component-based architecture. Vite was used to provide a fast development environment and a streamlined build process.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** I used the newest version of Tailwind to experiment with its CSS first configuration. This helped me build my custom Navy and Red theme efficiently.
- **GitHub API:** I integrated the GitHub GraphQL API to pull project data directly from my account. This keeps the Featured Projects section current without requiring manual code changes.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Building the data-fetching logic and state management for the modals served as a great way to brush up on core JavaScript concepts like asynchronous functions, environment variables, and array mapping.

## Primary Features

- **Dynamic Cards:** The project grid is automated by a build-script that identifies which of my repositories are pinned and public.
- **Double Modals:** I implemented two separate popouts for my resume and a "Story" section that includes a couple travel photos and some personal background.
- **High-Contrast Aesthetic:** The Navy Blue and Red palette was selected to create a professional, high contrast visual identity. This color scheme, paired with a clean UI, ensures the site is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
